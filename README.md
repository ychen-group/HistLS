# HistLS

This repository contains the implementation of the HistLS algorithm for Weighted Partial MaxSAT, as proposed in our paper:

[Improving Local Search for Weighted Partial MaxSAT by Initializing with Historical Information](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-95-0215-8_10)

## Usage Guide

To install and compile HistLS on a Unix/Linux machine, execute the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/jmhmaxsat/HistLS.git  
cd HistLS
make
```

After compilation, an executable file named HistLS will be available in the HistLS directory.
To run the algorithm, use the following command: `./starexec_run-runsolver.sh instance_name`.
